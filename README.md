# MERN-Stack-Application
This application allows a user to share places(with images & loaction) with other users. The application has authentication for you to login and add a place of your liking. You can also view places added by other users. The application is broken down into two parts: frontend(ReactJS) and backend(NodeJS, MongoDB and Express). Frontend is where a user can login, add a place and view places uploaded by other users. The backend part of the application is a REST API which is used by the frontend to get or store data from the database. MongoDB database stores the authentication details, places, images and user details.

To Run the application use Visual Studio Code or any IDE of your preference. Clone the repository and navigate to either the frontend or backend folder and run the following commands in the terminal:
### `npm install`

### `npm start`
